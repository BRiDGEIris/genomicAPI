*IMPORTANT*: current code is for test purpose and it is far from perfect. If an error occurred, see the logs files AND debug.txt file (debug.txt is a personal file to manage exceptions)

##**Requirements**

Library to install for python: pycurl 
Data uploaded should be added to user/hdfs/data/. Subfolders are not taken into account yet.
Data compressed will be uploaded to user/hdfs/compressed_data/. 
Those folders should be manually created by the developer if they do not exist yet.

Change the privileges for the application does not work, do it for hue in general (dumb way to do it, but it works):
```
cd /usr/lib/
sudo find hue -type d -exec chmod 0777 {} \;
sudo find hue -type f -exec chmod 0777 {} \;
```

###*Authentification:*
```
curl --data "username=cloudera&password=cloudera" -c "cookies.txt" -b "cookies.txt"

###*Request:*
 * Search for files containing the CUSTOMER_SAMPLE_ID and return {[customer_file_id, hdfs_file_path], ...}

    curl -c "cookies.txt" -b "cookies.txt" -X GET 
    http://quickstart.cloudera:8888/genomicAPI/api/files/search/<CUSTOMER_SAMPLE_ID>/
